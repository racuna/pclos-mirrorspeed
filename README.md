# pclos-mirrorspeed

Simple Bash script to compare the average speed of response of the different repository mirrors of PCLinuxOS.

PCLinuxOS is a small Rolling Release Linux distro, and my personal favorite at the moment.

## Requirements

- curl

## Usage

run pclos-mirrorspeed.sh and wait.

## Change Repository
After the speed comparision is important choose just one repo:

Open Synaptic:

> Config -> Repositories -> Choose One -> OK

Then click "Reload"

## Disclaimer
The devs and mantainers of PCLOS recommends to choose the first repo on the list, this script is just for testing.
